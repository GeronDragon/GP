   Verilog wrapper file provided to support functional simulation.
   This file contains simulation model customization data that is
   passed to a parameterized simulation model for the core.

dual_ram_core.veo:
   VEO template file containing code that can be used as a model for
   instantiating a CORE Generator module in a Verilog design.

dual_ram_core.vhd:
   VHDL wrapper file provided to support functional simulation. This
   file contains simulation model customization data that is passed to
   a parameterized simulation model for the core.

dual_ram_core.vho:
   VHO template file containing code that can be used as a model for
   instantiating a CORE Generator module in a VHDL design.

dual_ram_core.xco:
   CORE Generator input file containing the parameters used to
   regenerate a core.

dual_ram_core_flist.txt:
   Text file listing all of the output files produced when a customized
   core was generated in the CORE Generator.
